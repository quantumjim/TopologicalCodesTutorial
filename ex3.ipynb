    "# Exercise 3 - Quantum error correction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Historical background\n",
    "\n",
    "Shor's algorithm gave quantum computers a worthwhile use caseâ€”but the inherent noisiness of quantum mechanics meant that building hardware capable of running such an algorithm would be a huge struggle. In 1995, Shor released another landmark paper: a scheme that shared quantum information over multiple qubits in order to reduce errors.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "A great deal of progress has been made over the decades since. New forms of error correcting codes have been discovered, and a large theoretical framework has been built around them. The surface codes proposed by Kitaev in 1997 have emerged as the leading candidate, and many variations on the original design have emerged since then. But there is still a lot of progress to make in tailoring codes to the specific details of quantum hardware.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we'll consider a case in which artificial 'errors' are inserted into a circuit. Your task is to design the circuit such that these additional gates can be identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll then need to think about how to implement your circuit on a real device. This means you'll need to tailor your solution to the layout of the qubits. Your solution will be scored on how few entangling gates (the noisiest type of gate) that you use.\n",

    "## The problem of errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors occur when some spurious operation acts on our qubits. Their effects cause things to go wrong in our circuits. The strange results you may have seen when running on real devices is all due to these errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many spurious operations that can occur, but it turns out that we can pretend that there are only two types of error: bit flips and phase flips.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bit flips have the same effect as the `x` gate. They flip the $|0\\rangle$ state of a single qubit to $|1\\rangle$ and vice-versa. Phase flips have the same effect as the `z` gate, introducing a phase of $-1$ into superpositions. Put simply, they flip the $|+\\rangle$ state of a single qubit to $|-\\rangle$ and vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we can think of any error in terms of just these two is because any error can be represented by some matrix, and any matrix can be written in terms of the matrices $X$ and $Z$. Specifically, for any single qubit matrix $M$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M = \\alpha I + \\beta X + \\gamma XZ + \\delta Z,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for some suitably chosen values $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$ and $\\delta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So whenever we apply this matrix to some single qubit state $|\\psi\\rangle$ we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M |\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha |\\psi\\rangle + \\beta X |\\psi\\rangle + \\gamma XZ |\\psi\\rangle + \\delta Z |\\psi\\rangle.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting superposition is composed of the original state, the state we'd have if the error was just a bit flip, the state for just a phase flip and the state for both. If we had some way to measure whether a bit or phase flip happened, the state would then collapse to just one possibility. And our complex error would become just a simple bit or phase flip.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we detect whether we have a bit flip or a phase flip (or both). And what do we do about it once we know? Answering these questions is what quantum error correction is all about.\n",
